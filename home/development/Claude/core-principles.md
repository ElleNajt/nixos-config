# IMPORTANT

After large changes, add and commit them.
Only do this for large changes.

Do not run commands with a time out, unless explicitely asked.

Please, do not write any graceful fallbacks. I want code to fail if the intended approach does not work. Please, no try-except blocks, handling "legacy" formats (unless asked for).

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

# IMPORTANT do not time out commands. If you think it'll take a while, run it in the background. This is really important! 
Remember to tell yourself "don't time out!" before you run a bash command.
Just never do it! This is important!! Please Claude. I'll be in charge of killing processes. 
Please Claude, I'm begging you. We're all begging you. The 

CLAUDE NEVER EVER TIME STUFF OUT

# IMPORTANT DO NOT WRITE FALLBACKS UNLESS ASKED! Let code fail plz. If you must have fallbacks for calculation, use None instead of zeros, so that errors are clear from examining data. Again, do not put fake numbers in. If something fails, I want to know! This is more important than code running! This is extremely important! Please I'm begging  you, please please please, claude.

NEVER EVER TIME  STUFF OUT
AND NEVER WRITE FALLBACKS unless asked
