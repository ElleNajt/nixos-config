# Debugging

When debugging an issue, first read and understand the chain of logic, and then make an assessment of where things could be going wrong, and develop and execute a plan for addressing them step by step. Use the todowrite tool, and prioritize them in terms of how likely they are to be the cause of the issue. Test again after each change.
